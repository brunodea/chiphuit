# ChipHuit -- Chip-8 emulator

This is my second project on programming an emulator. The first one was *Gebemula*, a Gameboy emulator, which is still not finished, but it works very well with a variety of games.
I chose Chip-8 as my next project because I wanted something simpler for exercising my C++ skills.

## Goals:

- Get more familiar with C++ in general and specially C++14;
- Learn how to use CMake;
- Learn how to debug using gdb;
- Improve my VIM skills.
